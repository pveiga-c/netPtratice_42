# NETWORK 

### What is network?
##### In the context of technology, a network often refers to a system of interconnected 
##### computers or devices that can communicate with each other. This communication can occur 
##### through wired or wireless connections, and it allows the sharing of resources, information, and services.

### What is IP Address?
##### An IP (Internet Protocol) address is a numerical label assigned to each device participating in a computer 
##### network that uses the Internet Protocol for communication. It serves two main purposes: host or network 
##### interface identification and location addressing. IP addresses allow computers to send and receive data 
##### within a network or across the internet.

### What is TCP -IP ?
##### TCP/IP, which stands for Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol, is a suite of communication protocols 
##### that provides the foundation for the internet and many private networks. 
##### It defines how data should be packetized, addressed, transmitted, routed, and received across networks, 
##### facilitating communication between devices.

#### The TCP/IP protocol suite consists of several layers, each responsible for specific aspects of network communication. 
##### The two main protocols in this suite are:
##### Transmission Control Protocol (TCP): This protocol ensures reliable, connection-oriented communication 
##### between applications. TCP breaks down data into packets, numbers them for proper sequencing, sends them
##### to the destination, and verifies their successful delivery. It provides error checking and correction, 
##### making it suitable for applications where accuracy and reliability are crucial, such as file transfers 
##### and web browsing.

##### Internet Protocol (IP): IP is responsible for addressing and routing packets of data so that they can 
##### travel across networks and arrive at the correct destination. There are two main versions of IP in use 
##### today: IPv4 and IPv6. IPv4 is the older version and uses 32-bit addresses, while IPv6 is the newer version 
##### with 128-bit addresses, created to address the limited availability of IPv4 addresses.

## Private IP Address
##### CLASS A : 10.0.0.0 - 10.255.255.255
##### CLASS B : 172.16.0.0 - 172.31.255.255
##### CLASS C : 192.168.0.0 - 192.168.255.255

## CLASS C
##### IP Address 192.168.100.255 -> 11000000.10101000.110001000.11100001
##### Subnet Mask 255.255.255.0  -> 11111111.11111111.111111111.00000000
